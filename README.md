# MWiki-Machine-Learning-and-Math

Some most common information during designing Machine Learning algorithms. Including must have Math background for each task. Feel free to add some updates here. Thanks. 

### Optimization

* [[SGD, Momentum, RMSProp](http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-3/)] Nice general description for primary optimization objective in SGD, with Momentum, Nesterom, RMSProp and other. Also includes basic information during work with Neural Networks.
